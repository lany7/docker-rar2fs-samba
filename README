rar2fs + Samba
==============

This docker image makes a given directory containing RAR archives available on
the network through SMB as if the archives were extracted.

Note that it is running in privileged mode with net=host, which means a
container is far from fully isolated from the host system.

Usage
-----

```bash
fig up -d
ip addr add 192.168.0.101/24 broadcast 192.168.0.255 dev eth0
```
