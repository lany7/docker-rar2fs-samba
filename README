rar2fs + Samba
==============

This docker image makes a given directory containing RAR archives available on
the network through SMB as if the archives were extracted.

Note that it is running in privileged mode with net=host, which means a
container is far from fully isolated from the host system.

Usage
-----

```bash
fig up -d
```
